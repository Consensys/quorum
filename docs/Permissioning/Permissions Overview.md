# Quorum Permissioning Overview
Quorum supports two network permissioning models. 

* [Basic network permissioning](http://docs.goquorum.com/en/latest/Permissioning/Basic%20NetworkPermissions/): Controls which nodes can connect to a given node and also to which nodes the given node can dial out to.

* [Enhanced network permissioning](http://docs.goquorum.com/en/latest/Permissioning/Enhanced%20Permissions%20Model/Overview/): Caters for enterprise-level needs by having a **smart contract-based permissioning model**.  This allows for significant flexibility to manage nodes, accounts, and account-level access controls.

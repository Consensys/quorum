# Safeguarding Private Keys

## Quorum
### Storing accounts
As with geth, Quorum accounts can be stored in password-protected `keystore` files (geth's Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets support is not yet available in Quorum).  See the [geth documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/managing-your-accounts) for details on using file-based accounts. 

### Clef
`clef` is a tool that decouples the management of accounts from Quorum.  For more info see [Clef for Quorum](../Clef-for-Quorum).

## Tessera
For management of Tessera key pairs see [Tessera key configuration](../../Privacy/Tessera/Configuration/Keys/).

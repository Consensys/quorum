# account Plugins: For developers

New `account` plugins can be developed to extend the supported account management options for Quorum and `clef`. 

`account` plugins must satisfy the [documented gRPC API](../interface).  

!!! note 
    This documentation is auto-generated from the [Quorum Plugin Definitions](https://www.github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum-plugin-definitions) `account.proto` file *(available soon)*

To simplify the development of new `account` plugins the following `account` plugin SDKs are available: 

| Name | Language |
